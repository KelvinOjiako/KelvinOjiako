Howdy! I'm Kelvin Somtochukwu Ojiako

Recently picked up Kotlin & its been an exciting switch from Java.

Currently focusing on web development, previously used Spring with Java before finding Kvision, ktor & Spring Boot Kotlin Also found Gradle along the way and its flexibility in build automation is something I can't stop talking about. Folks who've made the switch from Maven understand the pom.xml hustle with them tags.

Interested in learning about AI & ML later on after mastering web development in Kotlin.

Android development is also another field I'm gearing towards
