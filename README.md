Howdy! I'm Kelvin Somtochukwu Ojiako

I'm a cross platform developer who mainly specialises in Kotlin Multiplatform. At the moment, I am learning Compose Web (the latest version that uses canvas) and plan to expand to android and IOS development later on. I also plan to delve into data science after mastering Multiplatform development.

Some projects I am working on or plan to begin soon:

COmpose Multiplatform Full Stack template for creating full stack applications that can target other architectures using jetpack compose's declarative UI toolkit.

A chess Neural network that can someday reach the level of alpha zero

An Inventory Management and restocking software with some pretty cool feautes

A chess App that can help train and improve rating
